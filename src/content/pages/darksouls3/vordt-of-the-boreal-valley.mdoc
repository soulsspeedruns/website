This page is meant to provide information on the speedrunning strategies for fighting **Vordt of the Boreal Valley** in [**Dark\_Souls\_III**](/darksouls3). The strategies on this page can be applied to any leaderboard category of the game.
**NOTE**: Strategies might vary if the weapon used in another category is different than the weapon used shown in the video examples here. The general concept of the respective strategy should still be similar either way.

## General information

- Vordt staggers on the **15th hit** by any weapon with poise damage similar to shortsword used in [**Any%\_No\_TearDrop**](/darksouls3/any-no-teardrop) or [**All Bosses**](/darksouls3/all-bosses). This can be used to skip the second phase charges entirely. However, how fast you trigger his phase transition may vary due to different damage outputs.
- Standing next to one of his rear legs will result in Vordt sidestepping, moving him closer to the door or any nearby wall which allows for easier strafing of his follow-up attacks.
- You will be able to strafe most of his attacks by simply standing underneath his belly, adjusting your position accordingly.
