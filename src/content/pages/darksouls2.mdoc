*Current Patch* categories are further split into:

- **Restricted**: Runners are required to lock their FPS to 60 using MSI Afterburner / Rivatuner and also display their framerate in their videos. FPS must never go down via malicious uses such as abusing PrintScreen, for fairness. Parrywalking is not allowed.
- **Unrestricted**: Runners are required to lock their FPS to 60 using MSI Afterburner / Rivatuner and also display their framerate in their videos. FPS can go down to any value the runner desires, wherever in the run. Parrywalking is allowed.

## Timing Rules

Because of significant discrepancies in load times on all the platforms, the official run time is counted using **RTA no load** which is displayed at all times during any Dark Souls II speedrun. This timing method only counts loading screens and strictly loading screens unlike the other games, be very aware of that.

---

- The timer **starts** the during the loading screen right after hitting New Game, and before the first cutscene in Things Betwixt.
- The timer **stops** on the first frame of the screen being completely black after killing either Nashandra or Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin, depending on the category being ran (the only exception is the All Achievements category, see the specific category rules).
