## Timing Rules

Any%: The run time for non-single character runs is counted as the [In-game time](/in-game-time) (IGT) of both character save file combined, for single character runs, it's simply the IGT of your file. [RTA](/real-time-attack) is optional.

All Bosses: The final time (IGT) is as follows: After killing Moon Presence, remember to obtain the boss' blood echoes as usual and then quit the game before the final black screen if possible. In case it's not possible, force quit the game using the PS4 dashboard (use the OPTION button when having the game application selected to bring up the menu), and finally booting up the menu to see the state of the save file.
