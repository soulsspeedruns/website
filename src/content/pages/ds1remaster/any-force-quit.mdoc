[**Dark Souls Remastered**](/ds1remaster) **Any% Force Quit** (formerly known as Any% Kiln Skip) is a speedrun category in which the player tries to complete the game as fast as possible. There are no added restrictions on how the player completes the game, they must simply start a new character and beat the final boss, Gwyn, as quickly as they can. [Glitches](/glitches), skips and sequence breaks are all allowed. Additionally the use of force quit mechanics is allowed in this category. These are generally banned for all categories otherwise. Using other programs to affect the game or editing the game code is not allowed; apart from a few exceptions allowed by the community.
