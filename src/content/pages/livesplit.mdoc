## Installation

Livesplit can be downloaded from their website directly: [http://livesplit.org/](http://livesplit.org/) They have their own introduction/guide: [http://livesplit.org/introduction/](http://livesplit.org/introduction/)

## Setup

Once downloaded and started, somewhere on your screen you should see this empty timer:

![](/pages/livesplit/livesplit_1.PNG)

This window can be right-clicked to reveal the settings:

![](/pages/livesplit/livesplit_2.PNG)

From here we click on "edit splits" to setup the autosplitter and to configure splits.

This window will open. Notice the red numbers.

1. This is where you fill in the game. Livesplit has a list of games and will autofill your text. You simply click on the game you want to speedrun:

![](/pages/livesplit/livesplit_4.PNG)

After that, it will become possible to activate SoulSplitter. SoulSplitter is the official plugin for Dark Souls PTDE, Dark Souls Remastered, Dark Souls III, Elden Ring, Sekiro: Shadows die twice and Armored Core 6.

From here we can look at the red numbers 2 and 3, number 3 is where you type the name of a split. Number 2 allows you to add more splits above or bellow the selected split.

It should now look something like this, with your own split names:

In order to enable automatic splits, we have to configure the autosplitter by clicking the highlighted settings button.

SoulSplitter can be configured by answering when/what/which. Many types are supported. For example, this configuration will automatically split when you kill asylum demon:

This is what it looks like after configuring:

From here, we can close soulsplitter's settings. We can also close the splits editor. Livesplit will now look like this:

One last important step in the setup is to right click it now, go to "Compare Against" and select "Game Time"

If you run Elden Ring or Armored Core 6, you will have to disable Easy Anti Cheat when doing runs, because SoulSplitter will not be able to access the game's memory. A guide for that is written here: [https://soulsspeedruns.com/eldenring/eac-bypass/](https://soulsspeedruns.com/eldenring/eac-bypass/) Note that the appid in this guide applies only to Elden Ring. The correct appid for AC6 is 1888160.

## Troubleshooting

**Missing files/anti-virus**

Sometimes windows defender or other virus scanners think that the plugin is a virus and will remove the files. This will cause livesplit to report an error, saying that the autosplitter could not be activated:

![](/pages/livesplit/activation_failed.png)

You can verify if all files are present on your system. Navigate to where you installed livesplit, and find a folder called "components". Inside this folder, you need these files:

- SoulSplitter.dll
- SoulMemory.dll
- MaterialDesignColors.dll
- MaterialDesignThemes.Wpf.dll
- soulmods_x86.dll
- soulmods_x64.dll
- soulmemory_rs_x86.dll
- soulmemory_rs_x64.dll
- launcher_x86.exe
- launcher_x64.exe

If any of these are missing, you have an incomplete installation. You can download the files manually here: [https://github.com/FrankvdStam/SoulSplitter/releases ](https://github.com/FrankvdStam/SoulSplitter/releases)

Alternatively, you can delete all the remaining files and restart livesplit. This will prompt livesplit to re-download the files. This might fix the problem. If the problem persists, you need to check your antivirus. In case of windows defender, look for any of the above files in your protection history, and click "restore" to allow the file.

You can filter on quarantined items to make it easier to find the right files.

It is also possible to add an exclusion for the files so that this does not keep happening:

Pick file:

![](/pages/livesplit/exclusion_pick_file.png)

Navigate to soulsplitter.dll and soulmemory.dll and add an exclusion for both these files.

![](/pages/livesplit/exclusions_added_for_both_files.png)

**It is not recommended to completely disable windows defender, or to exclude all of livesplit.**
