title: "Tumblebuff"
---

**Tumblebuff** is a glitch in [Dark Souls](/darksouls) which allows you to buff weapons which you normally can't buff with sorceries or miracles such as [Magic Weapon](//darksouls.wikidot.com/magic-weapon) or [Sunlight Blade](//darksouls.wikidot.com/sunlight-blade). Note that it doesn't work with items such as [Gold Pine Resin](//darksouls.wikidot.com/gold-pine-resin).\
You will get the most damage increase by buffing a weapon with the same elemental damage type as the weapon buff, for example [Blacksmith Giant Hammer](//darksouls.wikidot.com/blacksmith-giant-hammer) with Sunlight Blade.

## Procedure

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| This glitch abuses the following features of the game:- **Action Queuing**: Performing an action (e.g. using an item, two-handing a weapon) during an animation causes this action to be queued up and executed only after the animation is over. |

Have a buffable weapon in your right hand, start an animation such as rolling, queue up a weapon buff sorcery of your choice, switch out your buffable weapon with your non-buffable weapon while perfoming the animation. If done correctly your character will buff your newly equipped weapon.
