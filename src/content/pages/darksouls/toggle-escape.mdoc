## Tricks

There are a number of glitches, tricks and sequence breaks that can significantly shorten the amount of time needed to progress through the game. Dark Souls is a heavily exploitable game so the following list is only a selection of possible exploits most often used in speedruns.

Alternatively, videos of a large number of glitches, exploits and many other things are featured on [**this Google doc spreadsheet**](//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N34-ES_EQQ9-4VDm5h6NxBKtv3TdgB6q-R6Swf6engs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Rules

(These rules apply to all **Dark Souls** speedrun categories. Each category also has its own set of rules in addition to the ones listed here.)

- Because of significant discrepancies in load times and framerate on all the platforms, the official run time is counted as the [In-game time](/in-game-time) (IGT). The run ends once the credits appear, meaning you have multiple options to see your final time:
  - Use the [**In-Game Time Livesplit PlugIn**](//github.com/CapitaineToinon/LiveSplit.DarkSoulsIGT) to always be able to check your time.
  - Force-close the game via Alt + F4 on PC or the console dashboard on PS3/X360/Xbox One during the credits, restart the game and go to the **Load Game** screen in the main menu.
  - Quitout in NG+ and check your time. This has the disadvantage of counting the time spent in NG+, amounting to roughly 1-2s depending on your quitout speed.
- You may not make any modifications to the game that affect the gameplay itself. This includes DSFix's popular **framerate unlock feature** which has to be completely turned **off**. Unlocking the framerate and setting it to 30 FPS within the DSFix config file will still cause discrepancies as to how the game runs and is therefore also **banned**.
- You may not use the debug version of the game. Only the normal version is allowed.
- Third-party tools to change button/key mappings are allowed under the following constraints: Analog and digital signals can only be mapped to analog and digital forms of input respectively (**button to button, stick to stick**. For example, you may not bind analog stick positions to a single button press). Macros of any kind, turbo functions or bindings of any kind which bind a single button to multiple actions **are not allowed**.
- You may not cover up any UI elements in a way that makes them unreadable or hides information. Therefore it is mandatory to set the HUD to "ON" in Options > Display.
- Playing in **offline mode** is mandatory. Online play with other players or alone in any way is completely banned.
- If you use the [**Save & Quit**](/darksouls/save-and-quit) mechanic at any point during a run, you are required to **resume gameplay immediately** on the same character. Any delay in loading your character back in will cause a video to be **denied**, as you are intentionally keeping IGT from running without performing a game mechanic. Loading a different character intentionally in any way is not allowed, accidental mishaps will be looked past.
- The game may be restarted while in the main menu (during a quitout) for gameplay related reasons, such as RNG manipulation or crash prevention. Abuse of this rule to take breaks without the IGT running will result in a submission being denied. Without a game restart, gameplay has to be resumed immediately. See also the previous rule.
- Forcing the game to close by using **ALT + F4** or similar measures **is not allowed** in any category except [**Any% Force Quit**](/darksouls/any-force-quit). Unintended crashes of the game on the other hand do not invalidate a run as long as gameplay is resumed as soon as possible. This rule does not apply to the forced closing at the end of a run to validate the IGT as stated above.
- Pausing the game's state using the **ALT + SPACE** shortcut **is not allowed** in any category except [**Any% Force Quit**](/darksouls/any-force-quit). In it, **any unnecessary delay** in resuming gameplay outside of gameplay-related reasons **can get your run rejected** based on moderators' discretion.
- You may not use savefiles. Savefile runs are common when practicing categories with weapons that do not have 100% drop rates but these are not counted as 'official' times. Savefiles can also be abused to retry sections to improve the IGT so they are not allowed.
- Due to major recorded inconsistencies related to hardware, the usage of [**Firelink Skip**](/darksouls/firelink-skip) is banned in all categories.
